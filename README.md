This is the main organization for all projects made in Barcelona during Hackathons and Workshops.
In here, there will be tutorials and codes from past and present projects, where you can learn how arduino's, Laser Harps, Bionic Hands, Sensory Cabins and more work!
Any questions, there's a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/TechProjects-BCN/discussions) area in the organization page where you can ask questions, give feedback and talk with mentors.
